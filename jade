1 You are leanrning a lot that you didn't know before my dear.
2.Don't give up and never you quite running towards your dreams. 
3.everything I have always attempted, i was willing to fail. Don't accept failure is a default unless you fix it. Stay ontop of it and you will continue to learn. 
4.It's hard but i believe in you and you can do it!
5 Slowly but surely you shall reach your destination.
